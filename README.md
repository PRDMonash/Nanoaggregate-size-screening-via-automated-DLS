This repository contains the python script for the automated platform of synthesizing and size screening of nanoaggregates using inline DLS.  

Before running the code, prepare the "flow parameters setup" excel sheet with the experimental conditions to run and close the file.   

Assign the important parameters on particle size analysing software such as cuvette type, temperature, etc.    

Create four separate folders for excel files, plots, reports and scatter plots   

Run the python script.
